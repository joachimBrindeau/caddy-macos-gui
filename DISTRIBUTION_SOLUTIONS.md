# Distribution Solutions for Unsigned macOS Apps (2024)

## Current Situation
- **Free Apple Developer accounts** can only create apps for personal use (7-day expiration)
- **macOS Sequoia** removed the easy Control-click bypass for unsigned apps
- **No free alternative** exists for proper code signing

## Best Solutions Without $99/year Developer Account

### 1. üç∫ Homebrew Tap Distribution (BEST OPTION)
Create your own Homebrew tap for distribution. Users trust Homebrew and it handles quarantine automatically.

```bash
# Users would install with:
brew tap joachimBrindeau/caddy-gui
brew install --cask caddy-gui
```

**Pros:**
- Homebrew removes quarantine attributes automatically
- Users trust Homebrew
- Easy updates with `brew upgrade`
- No Gatekeeper warnings after installation

**Cons:**
- Requires maintaining a tap repository
- Users need Homebrew installed

### 2. üì¶ NPM Global Package
Distribute as an npm package that installs the binary globally.

```bash
# Users would install with:
npm install -g caddy-gui
```

**Pros:**
- No Gatekeeper issues for command-line tools
- Easy updates
- Cross-platform distribution

**Cons:**
- Not ideal for GUI apps
- Requires Node.js installed

### 3. üê≥ Docker Container
Package the app in a Docker container with web UI.

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 joachimbrindeau/caddy-gui
```

**Pros:**
- No code signing needed
- Cross-platform
- Easy deployment

**Cons:**
- Requires Docker
- Not native macOS experience

### 4. üåê Web App (PWA)
Convert to a Progressive Web App that runs in browser.

**Pros:**
- No installation needed
- No code signing issues
- Works everywhere

**Cons:**
- Limited system access
- Not a desktop app

### 5. üîß Enhanced Installer Script (Current Solution)
Continue with the current approach but improve it:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Enhanced installer that:
# 1. Downloads the app
# 2. Removes quarantine
# 3. Re-signs locally
# 4. Moves to Applications
# 5. Creates uninstaller
```

## Recommended Approach: Homebrew Tap

### How to Set Up a Homebrew Tap

1. Create a new GitHub repository named `homebrew-caddy-gui`

2. Create a Cask file `Casks/caddy-gui.rb`:
```ruby
cask "caddy-gui" do
  version "1.0.0"
  sha256 "YOUR_DMG_SHA256_HERE"

  url "https://github.com/joachimBrindeau/caddy-macos-gui/releases/download/v#{version}/Caddy.GUI_#{version}_aarch64.dmg"
  name "Caddy GUI"
  desc "Modern GUI for managing Caddy server configurations"
  homepage "https://github.com/joachimBrindeau/caddy-macos-gui"

  app "Caddy GUI.app"

  zap trash: [
    "~/Library/Application Support/com.joachim.caddy-gui",
    "~/Library/Preferences/com.joachim.caddy-gui.plist",
    "~/.caddy-gui",
  ]
end
```

3. Users install with:
```bash
brew tap joachimBrindeau/caddy-gui
brew install --cask caddy-gui
```

## Why Homebrew Tap is Best

1. **Automatic quarantine removal**: Homebrew handles xattr removal
2. **Trusted by users**: Developers trust Homebrew
3. **Easy updates**: `brew upgrade caddy-gui`
4. **Professional distribution**: Same method used by many popular apps
5. **No manual bypass needed**: Works immediately after installation

## Implementation Priority

1. **Keep current installer script** for immediate use
2. **Set up Homebrew tap** for better distribution
3. **Consider web version** for maximum accessibility
4. **Save for Apple Developer account** if app gains traction

## Note on Free Alternatives

After extensive research, there is **no free way** to achieve the same result as a paid Apple Developer certificate. All solutions are workarounds with trade-offs. The $99/year fee is Apple's intentional gatekeeping mechanism with no legitimate bypass.
